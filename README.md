My First NextJS app to fetch list of Github user from Github Users API and list in a table with pagination and then user's profile card is shown on clicking the username link from the table

User List page - A default screen which fetches Users from the Github API and displays them in a list. For each user you should show their Avatar, First Name, Last Name and Username. Each item in the list should link to the User Details page detailed below.

User Details page - A screen which shows more detailed information for the selected user. We can show extended profile information (such as company and social handles), a summary on their followers, following and number of public repositories.
